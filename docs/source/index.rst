Welcome to mwrogue's documentation!
===================================

mwrogue provides a client for interacting with the Fandom esports wikis, primarily Leaguepedia. The classes available here subclass those in the package mwcleric, and you may also want to check out `mwcleric's documentation <https://mwcleric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. Of particular note in that package is the cargo_client.
